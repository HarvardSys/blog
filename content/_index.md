The Harvard Systems Group at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) operates at the vital intersection of systems, theory, and hardware. We design and build the architectures, networks, and databases that form the backbone of modern computing.

From scaling global cloud infrastructure to optimizing the software-hardware interface, we don’t just study systems---we reinvent the layers that power the future.
